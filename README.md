After a long time, Iâ€™ve dived back into system programming using Go and explored syscalls to build a high-speed TCP echo server. This project has not only refreshed my knowledge of network programming but also highlighted the power and flexibility that syscalls can provide.

The goal of this project was to create a TCP echo server that efficiently handles multiple connections simultaneously while leveraging Go's concurrency model and syscalls for optimal performance.
